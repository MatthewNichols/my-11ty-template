# my-11ty-template
My starting point for new [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) projects. 11ty is a Jamstack static site generator that is simple to use/setup. It is easily hostable on Netlify, Github Pages or Cloudflare Pages, and countless other services.  

No guarentees, but I do make an effort to make it generally useful for a new project. It should run anywhere you cna run NodeJs If you have any questions, comments, or suggestions, please let open an issue and I will try to respond as soon as I can.  

## Key Dependencies
- nodejs and npm (whatever 11ty requires)
- 11ty
- @11ty/eleventy-plugin-webc

## Usage
- Create a new repo using this as a template by clicking the `Use this template` button, or if you prefer there are some command line options here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62630485/is-it-possible-to-create-a-new-git-repository-from-a-template-only-using-the-com/#answer-62632065
- Clone the repo to your local machine
- Run `npm install` to install the dependencies
- Run `npm run dev` to start the development server and watch for changes
- If all is well, you should be able to view the site at http://localhost:8080
